Introduction
______________________
Malignant brain tumours pose a significant challenge in medical diagnosis and treatment, necessitating precise and timely detection methods to improve patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, including manual segmentation and interpretation of MRI scans, are fraught with high inter-observer variability. This variability can lead to inconsistent treatment plans and outcomes, highlighting the need for more accurate and reliable diagnostic tools.

Aim and Objective
_______________________
This project aims to develop and evaluate a hybrid deep learning approach to accurately identify malignant brain tumours from MRI scans.
The proposed work is designed to meet the following objectives:
●	To prepare MRI scan datasets for analysis
●	To develop a hybrid CNN-Random Forest model for tumour classification.
●	To evaluate the hybrid model's performance on a testing dataset.
●	To assess the hybrid model's performance and optimise hyperparameters.
●	To deploy the optimised hybrid model for malignant brain tumour classification

Statement of Problem
__________________________
This research addresses the problem of malignant brain tumour detection by developing and evaluating a hybrid deep learning approach to accurately identify malignant brain tumours from MRI scans, assisting radiologists in early and precise diagnosis. Through this approach, the research seeks to mitigate the challenges identified in the literature, thereby enhancing the overall quality of brain tumour diagnosis and treatment. By integrating state-of-the-art AI methodologies, this study aspires to contribute to the reduction of diagnostic errors and the acceleration of diagnostic processes, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
